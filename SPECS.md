# specification.md — “Paper → AI → Your Vault” (iOS)

## 0. Summary
Build a **super-simple iOS app** with three stable native destinations:

1) **Capture**: a “scanner camera” for notebook pages (fast, offline-friendly).
2) **Library**: read-only browsing and local search of completed notes and verified original pages.
3) **Chat**: a plain LLM chat that can answer questions using your captured notes (“docs”).

Behind the scenes, the app:
- Stores scans locally, processes them with an LLM (Gemini) to **transcribe + structure + link**.
- Maintains a **Markdown vault** with opinionated organization (Johnny.Decimal-inspired).
- Optionally **syncs** the vault to an external destination (GitHub/Git remote/export folder). All sync complexity is hidden in **Settings**.

**Core promise:** “Write on paper. Snap pages. Everything becomes searchable, connected, and owned by you as plain Markdown.”

---

## 1. Goals / Non-goals

### Goals
- **Delightfully fast capture** (2–3 taps to scan a batch).
- **Automatic organization** with minimal user decisions.
- **Chat grounded in your notes** (with optional “where did that come from?”).
- **Data ownership**: plain Markdown + images, portable.
- **Sync as a setting**: user can ignore it and still get value locally.

### Non-goals (initially)
- Becoming a full notes editor (no rich editing UI).
- Complex graph visualizations.
- Real-time collaborative editing.
- Perfect handwriting OCR on-device (LLM does the heavy lifting).

---

## 2. Product principles (simplicity constraints)
1. **One obvious action per screen**
   - Capture screen: *Scan*
   - Chat screen: *Ask*
2. **Hide complexity**
   - No chips, no diffs, no commit logs in primary UI.
   - Advanced controls live in Settings.
3. **Safe automation**
   - Default: “auto-organize + auto-sync” (if enabled)
   - Provide “Undo last sync” and “Review mode” in Settings.
4. **Grounded by default**
   - Chat should prefer “I found X in your notes” over speculation.
   - If not found: say so and suggest what to scan/process.

---

## 3. Key concepts & terminology
- **Scan**: a single captured page image + metadata.
- **Batch**: a group of scans captured in one session.
- **Inbox**: unprocessed scans/batches waiting for transcription/organization.
- **Vault**: local folder containing Markdown notes + scan images.
- **System Rules**: a machine-readable + human-editable “philosophy” that teaches the LLM how to structure output.
- **Destination**: optional sync target (GitHub/Git remote/export folder).

---

## 4. UX: App structure

### Navigation
- Native labeled tabs: **Capture**, **Library**, **Chat**, in that order.
- Capture is the launch destination. Each tab retains its navigation, batch, and draft state.
- Settings is reachable from every destination; backup status remains secondary and actionable.

### 4.1 Capture mode (primary screen)
**Primary UI elements**
- Live camera view with scanner-style auto-detect.
- Big shutter button.
- Import Photos via a system selection picker; a batch stays open until Finish.
- Recent page count and access to pending scans.

**Secondary actions** (hidden behind a single “⋯” button)
- Review Inbox
- Choose Notebook (optional)
- Processing options (Wi‑Fi only, charging only)
- Settings

**Key behaviors**
- Auto crop/de-skew/enhance on capture (scanner feel).
- Offline capture always works.
- After finishing a batch, show one lightweight prompt:
  - “Processing in background” (if enabled)
  - Button: “Ask about this” → jumps to Chat with last batch implicitly prioritized.

#### Capture flow (happy path)
1. Open app → Capture screen.
2. User scans 1+ pages (batch).
3. Tap “Finish”.
4. App shows a small confirmation: “Saved. Processing when ready.”
5. User selects Chat to ask questions.

### 4.2 Chat mode (primary screen)
**Plain chat UI**
- Conversation list is optional (MVP can be single thread).
- Standard message bubbles, input field, send button.
- No visible context chips by default.

**“Smartly hidden” grounding**
- Each assistant response ends with a collapsed disclosure:
  - “Used sources ▸” (tap to expand)
  - When expanded: list of note titles + dates + “Open” actions.
- If answer is not grounded, show “Not found in notes” explicitly.

**Quick actions (minimal)**
- A small “📎” icon to attach the latest batch (optional; in MVP this can be implicit).
- A “Search notes” action inside the “Used sources” panel rather than cluttering the header.

#### Chat flow (happy path)
1. User asks: “What are my open tasks this week?”
2. App retrieves relevant notes (local index + LLM guidance).
3. Assistant answers + (collapsed) “Used sources”.
4. If assistant proposes an update (e.g., consolidate tasks), show a single CTA:
   - “Apply to vault” (not “Commit changes”)
5. On tap: apply changes locally; sync happens automatically if enabled.

---

## 5. Organization model (opinionated, minimal user input)

### 5.1 Vault structure (default)
The vault is **app-owned locally** and exportable.

vault/
00_inbox/                 # raw captures + initial transcripts
01_daily/                 # daily notes derived from pages
10_projects/              # project pages and related notes
11_meetings/              # meeting notes
13_tasks/                 # consolidated task lists (optional)
20_learning/              # optional category
_topics/                  # MOCs / topic pages (optional)
_system/
SYSTEM.md               # rules/instructions for LLM
INDEX.json              # machine index (titles, summaries, tags, links)
STRUCTURE.txt           # shallow tree snapshot for orientation
scans/
YYYY-MM-DD/
batch-/
page-001.jpg
page-001.json       # per-scan metadata

> Notes:
- We keep folder names simple and meaningful.
- Johnny.Decimal influence is in **category semantics**, not necessarily strict numbering (can be offered as a Settings toggle).

### 5.2 “System Rules” file (SYSTEM.md)
A short, evolving instruction file used by the LLM to stay consistent.
- Stored at: `vault/_system/SYSTEM.md`
- Editable in Settings as plain text (advanced users) plus high-level toggles (simple users).

**Default rule themes**
- “Depth over breadth; prioritize clean, composable notes.”
- “Prefer claim-style headings when confident.”
- “Weave wiki-links inline when referencing concepts/projects.”
- “Don’t invent facts; mark uncertain items as TODO.”
- “Keep a raw transcription section for traceability.”

### 5.3 Note style (output contract)
All notes are Markdown. Optional YAML frontmatter.

**Daily note example**
- `01_daily/2026-01-20.md`
  - Top: metadata (captured_at, source batch IDs)
  - Sections:
    - “Summary”
    - “Notes”
    - “Tasks” (checkboxes if detected)
    - “Links” (only if needed)
  - Raw transcription appended at the end for traceability.

**Linking**
- Use wiki-link style: `[[Project Atlas]]`
- Create project/entity pages lazily when first referenced.

---

## 6. Mechanisms (how the system works)

### 6.1 Processing pipeline (Inbox → Vault)
Processing should run:
- automatically in the background (default),
- respecting user constraints (Wi‑Fi only / charging only), configurable in Settings.

**Stages**
1. **Preprocess image** (on-device)
   - crop, deskew, contrast, glare reduction
2. **Transcribe** (LLM)
   - produce text + layout hints
3. **Structure** (LLM)
   - convert into clean Markdown with sections
4. **Classify & link** (LLM + local index)
   - choose folder/category
   - detect entities/projects
   - add wiki-links to existing notes
   - propose creating new entity notes if needed
5. **Update system indices**
   - update `INDEX.json`
   - update `STRUCTURE.txt` (periodically or on sync)
6. **(Optional) Consolidations**
   - tasks aggregation into `13_tasks/`
   - update topic pages in `_topics/` if enabled

**Important:** Always preserve traceability:
- Raw scan image is stored.
- Raw transcript is appended to the note under a "Raw transcription" section, with full JSON stored in per-scan metadata.

### 6.2 Chat retrieval (vault-aware, but hidden)
Chat uses a layered approach (fast + cheap):
1. Read `INDEX.json` (titles, summaries, tags, links).
2. Retrieve candidate notes via local search:
   - SQLite FTS on Markdown text + metadata
   - optional lightweight embeddings later
3. Expand via wiki-links (1 hop) for context.
4. Provide selected note texts to LLM with strict instructions:
   - answer grounded
   - cite sources internally
   - return “used sources” list for UI

**UI simplification**
- User does not manage context manually in the main UI.
- A “Used sources” disclosure makes grounding transparent without clutter.

### 6.3 “Apply to vault” changes (no diffs in main UI)
When chat proposes edits:
- Show a single card with:
  - “Apply to vault” (primary)
  - “Not now” (secondary)
  - “Preview” (hidden behind a small chevron, optional)

**Default behavior**
- Apply changes locally in a single transaction.
- Sync later if enabled.

**Advanced option (Settings)**
- “Review changes before applying”:
  - shows file list + basic preview
  - optional diff view (deep advanced)

### 6.4 Sync / Git abstraction (Destination)
Sync is modeled as a **Destination** with a simple user mental model:
- “Keep my notes backed up to: Off / iCloud Drive / GitHub / Other”

**Destinations (MVP)**
- Off (local only)
- Folder export (Files app / iCloud Drive)
- GitHub (OAuth) — optional if feasible in MVP, otherwise V1

**Git is not mentioned in primary UI**
- The UI says “Sync destination”.
- Commit/push is internal terminology only.

**Sync behavior**
- Background sync after processing and after “Apply to vault”.
- Automatic retries; clear user-facing error banner only when action is required (e.g., auth expired).

---

## 7. Settings (where complexity lives)
Settings use native grouped forms with focused destinations:
1. **Processing**: Gemini key setup/status, explicit **Process scans with Gemini** permission, automatic processing, quality, Wi-Fi and charging constraints. Image permission does not disable text-only chat requests.
2. **Backup**: destination (Off / Folder / GitHub / existing Custom Git Remote option), account and folder configuration, actual backup status, **Back up now**, Wi-Fi and charging constraints. No destination is enabled automatically.
3. **Privacy & Data**: local encryption and direct **Export notes**, with progress/error feedback. Encrypted ZIP files retain ciphertext and exclude the device-only key. Turning encryption off does not decrypt existing files.
4. **Organization**: folder style, linking, task extraction, topic pages, and notebook management. Notebook instructions have a labeled editor and visible save feedback.
5. **Advanced**: review-before-apply and system rules. Support diagnostics are available only in Debug builds.

Existing preference keys and recorded values are retained. Export no longer requires a visibility toggle.

---

## 8. Data model (suggested)
Use Core Data or SQLite + filesystem.

### Entities
- `Notebook` (optional)
  - id, name, default destination, rules overrides
  - MVP uses a single default notebook; multi-notebook selection lands in V1.
- `Batch`
  - id, created_at, notebook_id, status, scan_ids[]
- `Scan`
  - id, batch_id, image_path, processed_image_path, status, ocr_text, confidence, page_number
- `Note`
  - path, title, summary, tags, links[], updated_at
- `SyncState`
  - destination type, auth tokens (Keychain), last_sync_at, error state
- `Index`
  - materialized view of notes for retrieval (`INDEX.json` + local FTS)

### Status enums
- Scan: `captured | preprocessing | transcribing | structured | filed | error`
- Batch: `open | queued | processing | done | error`
- Sync: `off | idle | syncing | error`

---

## 9. Architecture (high level)

### iOS components
- **UI Layer**
  - CaptureViewController (camera + batch)
  - ChatViewController (chat + sources disclosure)
  - SettingsViewController (grouped)
- **Processing Engine**
  - Queue (serial per notebook; concurrency controlled)
  - Background tasks (BGTaskScheduler)
  - Image preprocessing module
  - LLM client (Gemini)
  - Vault writer (atomic file writes)
  - Indexer (updates FTS + INDEX.json)
- **Vault Storage**
  - Filesystem folder for vault
  - SQLite/FTS for quick retrieval
- **Sync Engine**
  - Destination interface:
    - FolderDestination
    - GitHubDestination (later: GenericGitDestination)
  - Retry + backoff, token refresh, minimal UI error surface

### Suggested internal interfaces
- `ProcessingQueue.enqueue(batchId)`
- `Transcriber.transcribe(scanImage) -> Transcript`
- `Organizer.organize(transcript, indexSnapshot, systemRules) -> FileOps[]`
- `Vault.apply(fileOps)`
- `Indexer.rebuildIncremental(changedPaths)`
- `Retriever.retrieve(query) -> ContextBundle`
- `ChatAgent.respond(query, contextBundle, systemRules) -> ChatResponse`
- `Destination.sync(vaultDelta)`

---

## 10. LLM interaction design (Gemini)

### Prompting strategy (robust + debuggable)
Prefer multiple small calls over one huge one (configurable by “Quality mode”).

**Fast mode**
- 1 call: transcribe + structure + classify

**Balanced mode (default)**
- Call A: transcription (return text + confidence + uncertain regions)
- Call B: structure + classify + link (using index snapshot)

**Best mode**
- A transcription
- B structure
- C linking pass with additional context (topic pages, recent notes)

### Strict output schemas
LLM should output JSON for operations, plus Markdown content:
- `fileOps`: create/modify files
- `noteMeta`: title, summary, tags, links
- `sourcesUsed`: list of paths (for “Used sources” UI)
- `warnings`: uncertain text, low confidence, TODO suggestions

This prevents “LLM wrote something but we can’t apply it safely”.

---

## 11. UX flows (detailed)

### Flow A: First launch (≤ 60 seconds)
1. Welcome explains that originals are local, Gemini receives permitted images for processing and selected text for chat, and backup is separately optional.
2. The person explicitly chooses whether to process scans with Gemini. Leaving this off keeps pages local and pending. An existing recorded choice is preserved during onboarding replay.
3. **Start scanning**, **Import Photos**, or **Explore the app** enters without requiring camera access or an API key. Camera permission is requested only at the camera action. A system selection picker imports photos without broad library access.
4. Local vault setup preserves existing content; backup remains off until configured.

### Flow B: Capture batch
1. User scans pages
2. Tap Finish
3. App confirms that pages are saved locally and queued, explaining when processing is allowed.
4. Background processing starts (if enabled)
5. User can select Chat and ask immediately; chat can answer with whatever is already processed, and can say “Some pages are still processing.”

### Flow C: Ask a question in Chat
1. User asks
2. Retriever selects notes (hidden)
3. LLM answers grounded
4. UI shows collapsed “Used sources ▸”
5. Optional: “Apply to vault” card if changes suggested

### Flow D: Enable Sync (Settings)
1. Settings → Sync → Destination
2. Choose “Folder” (MVP) or “GitHub” (V1)
3. Authenticate / pick folder/repo
4. Confirm: “Sync runs in background”

### Flow E: Error handling (minimal)
- If processing fails:
  - Inbox item shows a small warning icon
  - Tap → “Retry”
- If sync fails:
  - Small banner in Settings and a subtle icon in header
  - Don’t interrupt capture/chat unless necessary

---

## 12. Privacy, security, and ownership
- Store auth tokens in **Keychain**.
- Provide clear disclosure: “Images are sent to the LLM provider for transcription if enabled.”
- Keep vault **portable**:
  - export as ZIP
  - export to Files folder
- Optional (later): local encryption for vault contents.

---

## 13. Performance targets (practical)
- Capture shutter latency: < 300ms perceived (post-processing async).
- Batch of 10 pages:
  - preprocessing on-device: < 10s total
  - transcription/structuring: async; user can continue
- Chat response:
  - retrieval: < 300ms local
  - model response: dependent on network; show typing indicator

---

## 14. MVP scope (recommendation)
### MVP (ship)
- Native Capture / Library / Chat navigation
- Batch capture + Inbox
- Background processing to Markdown daily notes
- Local vault + local search (FTS)
- Chat grounded in processed notes
- Folder export destination (Files/iCloud)
- Basic Settings (Processing + Export)

### V1 (next)
- GitHub destination (OAuth) + background sync
- Linking + entity pages
- “Apply to vault” updates from chat

### V2
- Johnny.Decimal strict mode
- Topic pages (MOCs) + breadcrumbs
- Advanced review/diff mode

---

## 15. Acceptance criteria (definition of done)
- A non-technical user can:
  1) Scan 5 pages in under a minute
  2) Ask “What did I write yesterday?” and get a grounded answer
  3) Export their vault folder and open Markdown files elsewhere
- The main UI never mentions Git, commits, diffs, or indices.
- When the assistant is uncertain, it marks TODO rather than fabricating.
- All generated files remain valid Markdown; no proprietary lock-in.

---

## 16. Open questions / decisions (for team)
- Decision: Default sync is OFF; users opt in from Settings when ready.
- Decision: Raw transcripts live inline under "Raw transcription" and in per-scan metadata JSON (no separate transcript files yet).
- Open: Handwriting variability - offer a "pen type" calibration step?
- Decision: Multi-notebook support is V1; MVP uses a single default notebook.

End of specification.md


### Read-only Library and import — Plan 002

Library provides local search, completed note previews, complete Markdown text with a raw-text fallback, collapsed raw transcription when safely separable, and original pages only when committed scan metadata proves the association. Empty results and unavailable/recovering storage are distinct states. Pending scans keep their existing batch, pause, and retry states. Browsing does not create an editor or modify note content. Encrypted display and thumbnail data remain in memory.

Photo imports preserve the exact selected representation returned by the system picker with a validated JPEG, PNG, or HEIC extension. This is not a claim that the representation equals an inaccessible Photos master. Camera and import share durable original placement, metadata persistence, preprocessing, and retry handling. Multi-selection is processed sequentially; failures retain every already-saved original. A batch keeps its notebook until Finish; notebook changes apply to the next batch.

Chat keeps its draft, conversation, preferred batch, source expansion, and in-flight operations when changing tabs. Setup-blocked submissions retain the draft. Sources open the same read-only note detail. Stale proposals require **Refresh and review**, and regenerated operations require explicit review before application.
